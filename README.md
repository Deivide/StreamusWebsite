Overview
========
The Streamus website is an alternative download point for the Streamus Google Chrome extension. It also contains a small instructional guide, a brief history of the program and a donation page.

Development
========

1. Ensure you have Node, NPM, and Grunt installed.
2. Run "npm install" to install necessary dependencies.
3. Install Apache 2.4 and configure it such that it can find src/index.html
4. Run "grunt less" and then "grunt watch" to compile LESS to CSS and monitor for changes.
5. Navigate to src.streamus.com in your browser.
6. To build a release, run "grunt build". Versioning is not yet supported.

**Apache Configuration for Windows:** In order to develop Streamus' website properly you'll need to configure Apache. A few things are needed:

* You'll want to navigate to your hosts file and add entries for: "127.0.0.1 src.streamus.com" and "127.0.0.1 dist.streamus.com". This will allow for named websites instead of just localhost which helps satisfy CORS.
* You then need to modify your VHosts to expect these websites. My config looks like:

```
<VirtualHost src.streamus.com:80=''>
  DocumentRoot "${WEBSITEROOT}/src"
  ServerName src.streamus.com
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost dist.streamus.com:80=''>
  DocumentRoot "${WEBSITEROOT}/dist"
  ServerName dist.streamus.com
</VirtualHost>
```

where WEBSITEROOT points to my src directory such as:

```
Define WEBSITEROOT "/Users/Meo/Documents/GitHub/StreamusWebsite"
```

**Server settings:** Be sure to set localDebug to false in application.js unless you have a local instance of Streamus' server running.
