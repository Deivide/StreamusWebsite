                            <strong>Programming should be fun and useful.</strong> Streamus is my manifestation of that belief. 
                            One day, while sitting around with friends, having a couple of beers, I said to myself, "I bookmark YouTube way too much!"
                            Naturally, I took this thought way too far. The resulting chaos led to Streamus - my attempt at simplifying our YouTube streaming experiences.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <strong>I love music.</strong> Especially EDM. It seemed fitting to share Streamus with the world because, well, music is so much better when everyone gets to experience it... why should the software that makes it possible be any different?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Help me help you.</strong> Streamus isn't perfect and, without your help, it never will be. Reach out to me. I am friendly and interested in your ideas. How do you use YouTube?
                        </p>
