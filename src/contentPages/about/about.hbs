      <strong>Programming should be fun and useful.</strong> Streamus is my manifestation
      of that belief. One day, while sitting around with friends, having a couple
      of beers, I said to myself, “I bookmark YouTube way too much!” Naturally,
      I took this thought way too far. Three years of effort has led to Streamus -
      my attempt at simplifying the YouTube music experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I love music.</strong> Especially EDM. It seemed fitting to share
      Streamus with the world because, well, music is so much better when everyone
      gets to experience it&hellip; why should the software that makes it possible
      be any different?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Help me help you.</strong> Streamus isn't perfect and, without
      your help, it never will be. Reach out to me. I am friendly and interested
      in your ideas. How do you use YouTube?
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll make Streamus. You buy me a beer at <a class='{{styles.link}}' href='http://electricdaisycarnival.com/' target='_blank'>Electric Daisy Carnival 2016</a>. Deal? ;)
