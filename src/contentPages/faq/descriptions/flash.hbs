This issue can usually be solved by either going to <streamus-link href='https://www.youtube.com/html5' target='_blank'>https://www.youtube.com/html5</streamus-link> and ensuring HTML5 is enabled, or by disabling all
your extensions including Streamus and then re-enabling Streamus. You can enable/disable extensions by going to chrome://extensions/ and clicking the
'Enabled' checkbox next to each extension.
