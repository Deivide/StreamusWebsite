This issue is most commonly caused by an out-of-date browser. Please ensure that you're using a current version of Google Chrome or Opera. In Chrome, you can check this by going to chrome://chrome/.
In Opera, you should go to 'Opera -> About Opera' through the menu in the upper-left corner.

Also, ensure that you have JavaScript enabled for Streamus. You may need to whitelist the extension if you have JavaScript disabled by default.

If you continue to experience issues, please e-mail me and I will help you work through the problem.
