This issue is most commonly caused by too high of a zoom level. Chrome forces extensions to have a maximum width of 800px. Streamus is 640px wide.
However, the actual width is modified by your zoom level. So, if you have 125% zoom, then Streamus is actually 800px wide. 150% zoom causes Streamus' UI
to become truncated.

To resolve this, you'll need to go to: chrome://settings/ --> Show advanced settings --> Web Content and set Zoom to 125% or less.

Additionally, I consider this issue to be a bug in Google Chrome. I reported it to Google <a class='{{data.root.styles.link}}' href='https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=420382' target='_blank'>here</a>.
Please consider +1'ing and 'starring' the issue to increase its priority, thanks!
