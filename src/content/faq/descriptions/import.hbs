You have two options. You can either copy/paste the playlist's URL into Streamus' search and work with the songs individually, or you can open the left-side navigation drawer,
click the 'Create Playlist' button, and copy/paste the playlist's URL into the URL input box. Streamus will then import the playlist for you.
