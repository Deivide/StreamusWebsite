                Can you please explain Streamus' permission requests?

                <p>
                    <strong>Permission:</strong> "Read and change your data on all pro.beatport.com sites and all youtube.com sites"
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Streamus enhances pro.beatport.com to provide you with full versions of the songs Beatport is previewing. To do so, it injects new buttons into their website.
                    Additionally, Streamus enhances youtube.com by adding an "Add to Streamus" button underneath YouTube videos which you can use as a shortcut for saving songs.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Permission:</strong> "Communicate with cooperating websites"
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> This simply means that streamus.com is able to ask the extension if it is installed. If so, the buttons on the website will indicate that you have Streamus installed.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Permission:</strong> "Know your email address"
                    <br/>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Streamus does not use your email address. It does use your G+ ID to save your playlists. Without this, your playlists would be lost if you uninstalled Streamus.        
                    For some users their G+ ID is their email address. So, since Chrome v41, Google requires me to ask for permission to know your email address in order to know your G+ ID and save your playlists.
                </p>

                I take permissions very seriously and am actively working on reducing the number of permissions Streamus requires whenever possible. Thank you for understanding!

                No. Additionally, there are no plans to create one in the near future. It's too much work for one person to develop an app for

                No. However, it is on my list of features to explore in the future. I do not have a timeframe. It is
                non-trivial to support multiple browsers and Firefox has far fewer users than Webkit browsers.

                No. YouTube forbids downloading songs from YouTube when using their API. The reason websites are able to offer this service is because
                they are not using YouTube's API for searching for music. It's not illegal to download the songs from YouTube, but they could shutdown Streamus
                if I did provide such a service.

                Not substantially. The full YouTube video is still loaded and played. It is a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service to separate the audio from the video. However,
                you will not load all the additional content on YouTube pages which will save some bandwidth.

                You have two options. You can either copy/paste the playlist's URL into Streamus' search and work with the songs individually, or you can open the left-side navigation drawer,
                click the 'Create Playlist' button, and copy/paste the playlist's URL into the URL input box. Streamus will then import the playlist for you.

                The NETWORK_FAILED error indicates that there's an issue with your Google Chrome or Opera installation. The easiest way to fix this is by uninstalling your browser and
                then reinstalling it. Otherwise, you can try clearing your browser's cache and restarting your PC. This may or may not fix your issue.

                This issue can usually be solved by either going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/html5" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/html5</a> and ensuring HTML5 is enabled, or by disabling all
                your extensions including Streamus and then re-enabling Streamus. You can enable/disable extensions by going to chrome://extensions/ and clicking the
                'Enabled' checkbox next to each extension.

                This issue is most commonly caused by an out-of-date browser. Please ensure that you're using a current version of Google Chrome or Opera. In Chrome, you can check this by going to chrome://chrome/.
                In Opera, you should go to 'Opera -> About Opera' through the menu in the upper-left corner.
                
                Also, ensure that you have JavaScript enabled for Streamus. You may need to whitelist the extension if you have JavaScript disabled by default.
